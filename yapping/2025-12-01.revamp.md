We are going to revamp my piing utility.
Currently, the app just does the ping stuff and logs to the console.
We are going to adopt code from the teamy-rust-cli and use the teamy-windows crate to set things up.
We will copy entire files from teamy-rust-cli as needed, but we will add the teamy-windows package and others from crates.io using `cargo add` instead of manually editing the cargo.toml file.

Things I want:
- use PIING_HOME env var, defaulting to windows-rs to resolve a canonical path for %appdata%\teamdman\piing to determine the "home" directory for the app

inside there, we will have

we will have

piing

will launch the app, which gets a tray icon with a "Exit" and "Show logs" and "Open home folder" and "Reload config" menu items

The app will on launch by default log to $PIING_HOME/logs/piing_2025-12-01_22-20-30.log.ndjson (using current local datetime) but can be overridden using a --log-file argument

The app will use tracing to do structural logging, the teamy-rust-windows-cli has code we can copy for this

we will also have a --debug flag to set the log level to debug

piing host add teksavvy.ca

will update

$PING_HOME/config/hosts.txt

where each line is a host to be pinged

piing mode set tcp|icmp|http-get|http-head

will update

$PING_HOME/config/mode.txt

where this file determines how the pings are done

the reload config will re-read these config files

piing interval set 1s

will update

$PING_HOME/config/interval.txt

where this file determines the ping interval

the piing app will have the tray icon and log to the log file as pings are done using tracing structured logging to show

timestamp, host, mode, success/failure, latency_ms


I've added generated-image.png and you should copy the make-icon.ps1 helper to the piing project to generate the icon files from the png.
